# Ragdoll-Module
 A module script for Roblox for creating a simple ragdoll with some quality of life features.

 This module allows you to use a Ragdoll Class to create Ragdolls using a Character Model for a parameter. In order to use this for player models, the implementation of a Local Script listening to a Remote Event is necessary. This is so that the effect of the Ragdoll is replicated to all clients. This would also mean that this function is meant to run on the server.
